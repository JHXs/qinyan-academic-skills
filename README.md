## 🧬 Nature-style scientific writing suite

Move from a defensible scientific claim to a submission-ready manuscript with five focused, composable skills:

| Manuscript stage | Skill | Primary output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Argument and drafting | [`qinyan-nature-writing`](./skills/沁言学术skills/qinyan-nature-writing/) | Evidence-led narrative, section drafts, title, abstract, and submission package |
| Structural and language revision | [`qinyan-nature-polishing`](./skills/沁言学术skills/qinyan-nature-polishing/) | Concise academic prose with meaning-preservation and anti-overclaim checks |
| Pre-submission assessment | [`qinyan-nature-review`](./skills/沁言学术skills/qinyan-nature-review/) | Prioritized, traceable review findings with stable issue identifiers |
| Figures and visual evidence | [`qinyan-nature-figures`](./skills/沁言学术skills/qinyan-nature-figures/) | Reproducible multi-panel figures with export and preflight validation |
| Study design and statistics | [`qinyan-nature-statistics`](./skills/沁言学术skills/qinyan-nature-statistics/) | Estimand-aware analysis plans, reporting audits, and figure-ready results |

Install one skill:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonChaoX/qinyan-academic-skills/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --skill qinyan-nature-writing
```

## 🚀 Quick start

### Install everything

The default target is the global Claude Code skills directory.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonChaoX/qinyan-academic-skills/main/install.sh | bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> The installer requires Bash, Git, and `curl`. On Windows, run it in WSL or Git Bash. Review [`install.sh`](./install.sh) before piping it to Bash if your environment requires source inspection.

### Install only what you need

```bash
INSTALLER="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonChaoX/qinyan-academic-skills/main/install.sh"

# Install one category
curl -fsSL "$INSTALLER" | bash -s -- --category 01

# Install one skill
curl -fsSL "$INSTALLER" | bash -s -- --skill scanpy

# Install into the current project instead of globally
curl -fsSL "$INSTALLER" | bash -s -- --project --skill scientific-writing

# Target another supported agent
curl -fsSL "$INSTALLER" | bash -s -- --tool codex
```

Short forms such as `-c`, `-s`, and `-t` are also supported. Run `bash install.sh --help` for the complete command reference.

### Discover and maintain skills

```bash
# Browse and search
bash install.sh --list
bash install.sh --list-skills
bash install.sh --search "protein"

# Inspect and update
bash install.sh --status
bash install.sh --check-update
bash install.sh --update
bash install.sh --update --skill scanpy
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonChaoX/qinyan-academic-skills.git
cd qinyan-academic-skills
bash install.sh --help
```
